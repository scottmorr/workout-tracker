For this assignment, I created a workout tracker.  To build the workout-tracker I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
Below is the area of the tracker where you can choose to create or continue a workout.

Another great feature is that workout-tracker allows the user to see how much they excercise each day!
